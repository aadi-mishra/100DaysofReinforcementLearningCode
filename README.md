### This repository is work under progress.

Here you can code to understand basics of solving a RL based problem using Tensorflow.
- Tensorflow (keras)
- keras-rl
- OpenAI gym environment
- numpy

In each of the projects you can find 
* `environment.py` - file which which provides state observations and reward based on certain actions. I can also be run independently with some randomized actions.
* `train.py` - Trains the model based on defined agent and policy.
* `test.py` - Performance can be visualized after training.

* Folder `cartpole_DQN` consists pendulum on a cart experiment with trained weights
* Folder `spaceInvaders` consists an RL agent playing classic atari Space Invader game. Unfortunately, I couldn't upload the weights which I had trained for almost 36 hours due to its large size.
